### Welcome to the repository of the crash course (3h) in web scraping.

Welcome to the repository of the crash course (3h) in web scraping.

You can find the slides [here](2024_EconomIA_webscraping.pdf).

The webpage I/we created during the class is in the [my-webpage](my-webpage/) folder (web page [here](https://lrberge.github.io/2024_webscraping/website/index.html)). 

To publish online the websites we all created, have a look at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): you can publish a website by drag-and-dropping your folder in about 5s! (That's pretty impressive tbh.)

To play with selectors: see [my website](https://lrberge.github.io/learn_selectors/).

Finally the small exercise with the Members of the European Parliament is in the file [scraping-inclass.py](scraping-inclass.py).

I hope you enjoyed the class. Have fun now!
